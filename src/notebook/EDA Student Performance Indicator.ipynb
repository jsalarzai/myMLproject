You can access the dataset from the following link: [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?select=StudentsPerformance.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Columns Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Gender**\n",
    "    * This represents the sex of the student. It's a categorical value with two categories: 'Male' and 'Female'.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Race/Ethnicity**\n",
    "    * This column reflects the racial/ethnic background of the students. It is also a categorical value, with several distinct groups labeled from 'group A' to 'group E'.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Parental Level of Education**\n",
    "    * This describes the highest level of education attained by the student's parents. This could range from high school, some college, associate's degree, bachelor's degree, master's degree, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lunch**\n",
    "    * This represents whether the student is on a standard or free/reduced lunch program at the school. This could be an indicator of the socioeconomic status of the student's family.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Test Preparation Course**\n",
    "    * This column indicates whether the student completed a test preparation course or not. This is a binary categorical feature with possible values of 'none' or 'completed'.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Math Score**\n",
    "    * This column represents the student's score in Mathematics. It's a numerical value ranging from 0 to 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reading Score**\n",
    "    * This column represents the student's score in Reading. It's a numerical value ranging from 0 to 100.\n",

    "# 3. Data Checks Description\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Loading\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check successful data load**: Ensure the data has been loaded correctly without any errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Missing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check for Null values**: Check if there are any missing values (NaN, Null, None, etc.) in the dataset for all columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Percentage of missing data**: If there are missing values, compute the percentage of missing data. This can help decide whether to impute these missing values or discard the column entirely if the majority of values are missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data types**: Check the data types of each column and make sure they match the description. If there's a mismatch, data conversion might be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unique values**: For categorical variables, check the unique values and their count. This is useful for understanding the distribution of the categories and identifying any unexpected or erroneous categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Statistical summary**: For numerical columns, check the summary statistics like mean, median, mode, min, max, standard deviation etc. This helps understand the distribution of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Outliers**: Look for any outliers in the numeric columns, as they may affect the overall analysis and model performance. Outliers can be identified by visually plotting the data or statistically (for example, using Z-score, IQR).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Consistency of categories**: Check if there are inconsistencies in the categorical columns. For example, are 'Male' and 'male' being treated as different categories? \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data range**: Check if the values of numerical columns (e.g., scores) fall within the expected range (e.g., 0-100 for exam scores).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Correlation matrix**: It's useful to calculate a correlation matrix between numerical variables to see if there are highly correlated variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Duplicates\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Duplicate rows**: Check if there are any duplicate rows in the dataset. Duplicate data can bias the analysis, so you need to decide whether to keep, remove, or consolidate duplicate entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, each of these checks may reveal issues with the data that need to be resolved before continuing with the analysis. The nature of the issues and how they should be addressed will depend on the specific context and purpose of the analysis.\n"

    "\n",
    "- The average (mean) Mathematics score is approximately 66.09, which suggests that students tend to perform moderately well in Mathematics.\n",
    "- The standard deviation is around 15.16, indicating there's a fair amount of variation in the Mathematics scores. Some students have very high scores, and others have very low scores.\n",
    "- The minimum score in Mathematics is 0, indicating that at least one student has scored zero in Mathematics. This could be due to several reasons such as not attempting the exam, lack of understanding, or other factors.\n",
    "- The maximum score is 100, indicating that at least one student has achieved full marks in Mathematics.\n",
    "- The 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles suggest that half of the students have scores between 57 and 77.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The average Reading score is approximately 69.17, which is slightly higher than the average Mathematics score.\n",
    "- The standard deviation is around 14.6, which is a bit less than that for Mathematics. This might suggest that students' Reading scores are slightly more clustered around the mean compared to Mathematics.\n",
    "- The minimum Reading score is 17, and the maximum is 100. This shows that students overall performed better in Reading compared to Mathematics as the lowest score is significantly higher.\n",
    "- Half of the students have Reading scores between 59 and 79.\n",

    "## Writing Score\n",
    "\n",
    "- The average Writing score is around 68.05, which is close to the average Mathematics score, but slightly less than the average Reading score.\n",
    "- The standard deviation is approximately 15.19, indicating a similar spread to the Mathematics scores.\n",
    "- The minimum Writing score is 10, and the maximum is 100. The minimum is higher than that of Mathematics but lower than Reading, indicating that students on average found the Writing section slightly more challenging than Reading but less so than Mathematics.\n",
